# HTTP Interaction Overview

    # Client

        so with rival up until around a few weeks ago I was using aiohttp which is a very general practice when it comes to python discord bots
        however upon wanting to create something better and more efficient when it comes to memory usage and speed I created rust-requests
        which has lazy json loading, and is made in rust so it is extremely fast.
        its around 75% faster and over 150% more memory efficient than aiohttp
        it is public and can be installed via pypi using pip install rust-requests
        
        # Example usage
        from rust_requests import Client, Request
        client = Client()
        request = Request("GET", "https://rival.rocks/", headers = {"User-Agent": "Rival Discord Bot"})
        response = await (await client.send(request)).json()
        return response.query()

        the lazy loading json part example is below

        from rust_requests import Client, Request
        client = Client()
        request = Request("GET","http://ip-api.com/json/24.48.0.1", headers = {"User-Agent": "Rival Discord Bot"})
        response = await (await client.send(request)).json()
        return response.query("isp")
        
        which only gets the value of the specified key and doesn't load the rest of the json into memory

    # Security

        so for security I use multiple things, proxies and I also have a cloudflare proxy worker, aswell as cloudflare warp for basic tasks

        proxies are from iproyal
        the cloudflare proxy worker is https://proxy.rival.rocks/?url=urlherelol
        so cloudflare warp is a free service that allows you to use cloudflare as a proxy
