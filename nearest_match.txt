So for anything that is nearest match picking, I use another python rust binding I made
pip install fast-string-match
with fast string match there are two functions
closest_match_distance, and closest_match
distance is distanced using Damerau Levenshtein's algorithm
non distanced is just regular close match finding (which can be inaccurate at times)
I opt for distanced over non distanced but it is your choice
